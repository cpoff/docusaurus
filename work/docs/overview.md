-The primary objective of our website is to deliver information, and we should expect a range of users from the casual browser to the focused seeker. 

-The site is built using the Generate Press framework on WordPress. Kristin owns the style (CSS) and Curt owns the CMS, functionality, and code (HTML, including elements/hooks). Several items on PAG are copied from the RTA code library and vice versa. The platform is the same so components are fully interchangeable. 

 -We have two page types: Page and Post. Page is a more rigid structure that contains both content pieces and references/pointers to additional content further down the line. This includes the homepage and inside index pages. There may be need to more than one index page variety depending on the depth of the taxonomy. Post is an endpoint type ideally suited for single content pieces such as news, blogs, press releases, etc. that don't lead elsewhere.

-Content is organized and delivered according to a taxonomy, which Curt owns/manages. That taxonomy is represented in the CMS (unique for each site) and delivered to the site as Categories. This forms the structual hierarchy of the site content. 

-Posts can also have 'tags' which act as proxy categories, but aren't maintained in a rigid structure. Tags give us the ability to generate and deliver dynamic index pages.

-We also have to deliver documents. These documents have their own rules for formatting and content. They will delivered using dedicated software components and will have their own micro-taxonomy. Same goes for events.
